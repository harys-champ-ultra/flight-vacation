# Flight Vacation Website

## Project Description:
The project is a web application developed using JavaScript, Node.js (Express.js), EJS, CSS (SCSS), and MySQL. It aims to provide users with a basic flight vacation booking experience. The application includes various features such as package listings, user authentication, package following, shopping cart functionality, and checkout process.
The application's frontend is built using JavaScript, EJS, and CSS (SCSS) to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and scalable server-side infrastructure. The data is stored and managed using MySQL, ensuring secure and efficient data storage.
The user experience begins with a sign-up and sign-in process, where the application validates the user's credentials and provides success or error indications accordingly. Once signed in, the user is greeted with a personalized welcome message on the home page. They can then access the packages page, which displays various vacation packages.
The application also features a "followed" page, where users can keep track of the packages they are interested in. Additionally, there is a separate cart page that allows users to view the items they have added to their cart. The checkout process requires users to input their 16-digit bank account number and card expiry date. The application validates this information and displays a success or error message accordingly.
To ensure a seamless user experience, the application includes a sign-out functionality that redirects the user back to the home page upon signing out.
